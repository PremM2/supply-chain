 Project Description: End-to-End Supply Chain Analysis Using Power BI and SQL
Project Title:
Supply Chain Performance Optimization through Data Analytics

Project Overview:
This project involved designing and executing a complete end-to-end supply chain data analysis solution using SQL for data modeling and Power BI for interactive visualization and insights generation. The primary objective was to uncover inefficiencies, quality issues, and performance bottlenecks across the supply chain â€” from suppliers and manufacturing to logistics and customer delivery.

Objectives:
Monitor and analyze product availability, sales, revenue, and defect rates

Evaluate supplier and shipping carrier performance

Track stock levels, inspection results, and logistics routes

Identify customer trends and their impact on revenue and quality

Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize operations and reduce costs

 Data Sources & Fields:
The dataset covered multiple dimensions of supply chain operations including:

Product Info: Product_type, SKU, Price, Availability, Stock_levels

Sales & Revenue: Number_of_products_sold, Revenue_generated, Order_quantities

Quality: Inspection_results, Defect_rates

Suppliers: Supplier_name, Location, Lead_time, Manufacturing_costs

Shipping & Logistics: Shipping_times, Shipping_carriers, Shipping_costs, Transportation_modes, Routes, Costs

Customer: Customer_demographics

Tools & Technologies Used:
SQL: Data modeling, cleaning, joins, aggregation logic, and transformations

Power BI: Report building, DAX measures, interactive dashboards

Excel/CSV (as intermediate format): For data import into Power BI if needed

 Key Analytical Techniques:
Descriptive analytics using bar charts, KPIs, and slicers

Comparative analysis by product type, supplier, and route

Data segmentation by customer demographics

Quality and cost correlation by carrier and transport mode

Performance ranking by supplier and location

 Key Deliverables:
A dynamic Power BI dashboard showing end-to-end supply chain health

Actionable insights and recommendations to reduce costs and improve quality

A stakeholder-ready report story aligning business problems with data solutions
 Outcomes:
Identified overstocked product categories with underwhelming sales

Highlighted locations and logistics routes with high defect risks

Evaluated carrier cost vs. defect trade-off for shipping strategy optimization

Provided insight into customer segments with high satisfaction vs. risk

Empowered stakeholders with clear, visual, and actionable data for operational decisions
